# SMALL-PROJECTS-ON-MACHINE-LEARNING
In this repository, I will be sharpening out my machine learning skills by making small and detailed project of each algorithm. By the end of 30 days, I expect to be fully able to have good understanding over the algorithms which, might be, used in the making of the small projects. after the completion of this 30 days challenge, which I have honestly taken by myself, I expect myself to have multiple small projects with various, numerous, algorithm.
